QUANTA Security is a futuristic Quantum Networking application that will be able to control the quantum hardware remotely for all security purposes.

<b> Does your project address a real world problem? </b>

In 2001, Shorâ€™s algorithm was demonstrated in lab by IBM group using NRM implementation of Quantum computers.
Sending quantum information over large distances has already been demonstrated by Chinese Scientists from USTC.
IBM with over 52 qubits can be remotely accessed by public and Google has announced its quantum supremacy on last October.  
While these progresses are in its earlier stages, with the rapid development in technologies,
we will have to address its challenges  and use quantum computation on our side for strengthening digital security.

<b> How is it going to help the future of our society? </b>

QUANTA Security is a Quantum Networking application which will be able to control the quantum hardware remotely for receiving and sending data. Instead of the current cryptographic techniques, QUANTA Security will use full quantum encryption methods. Quantum computers are very sensible to the external noises. So, real quantum computers will be very likely kept in a secured place like in Thales lab where conditions necessary for quantum computers are maintained. With QUANTA Security, users will be able to access the remote quantum computers for digital security. In the future age of quantum computing, QUANTA will be there to secure networking.

<b> How does it differentiate from other solutions already available? </b>

As mentioned before,  current cryptographic methods are flawed in the quantum lens. Thus, QUANTA is completely different from existing classical solutions. Because the field of quantum information is relatively young, there are not many existing solutions for quantum networking and quantum cryptography. Our solution is different than those existing ones as it focuses on allowing users to remotely access quantum computers for cryptographic purposes.The project 1.2
