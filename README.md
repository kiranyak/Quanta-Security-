QUANTA Security is a futuristic Quantum Networking application that will be able to control the quantum hardware remotely for all security purposes.

Does your project address a real world problem? 

In 2001, Shorâ€™s algorithm was demonstrated in lab by IBM group using NRM implementation of Quantum computers.
Sending quantum information over large distances has already been demonstrated by Chinese Scientists from USTC.
IBM with over 52 qubits can be remotely accessed by public and Google has announced its quantum supremacy on last October.  
While these progresses are in its earlier stages, with the rapid development in technologies,
we will have to address its challenges  and use quantum computation on our side for strengthening digital security.
